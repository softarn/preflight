# Preflight - AI-Powered Code Reviewer

Preflight is a command-line tool that uses the power of local Large Language Models (LLMs) to perform an AI-powered review of your git diffs. It helps you catch potential bugs, security vulnerabilities, and style issues before your code is ever committed.

The tool runs entirely on your local machine, ensuring your code remains private.

## Features

- **Local First:** Your code never leaves your machine. Analysis is performed by an LLM running locally.
- **Git Integration:** Analyzes the difference between your current branch and a base branch (e.g., `master`).
- **GPU Accelerated:** Supports GPU acceleration via Apple Metal for significantly faster analysis on modern Macs.
- **Streaming UI:** Watch the AI's "thought process" in real-time in a live-updating terminal panel.
- **Configurable:** Easily change the model, context size, and other parameters to suit your needs.

## Installation

> **Prerequisite:** This tool requires Python 3.9+ and `pipx`.

The recommended way to install `preflight` is using `pipx`, which installs the tool in an isolated environment.

```bash
# This will be the command once published to PyPI
pipx install preflight
```

For this alpha release, you will install it from a built `.whl` file or via Homebrew (see below).

### Homebrew (for Beta Testers)

Once the Homebrew tap is set up, you can install it with:

```bash
# 1. Add the personal tap (only needs to be done once)
brew tap your-username/preflight

# 2. Install the tool
brew install preflight
```

## Usage

To run a review, simply use the `review` command and provide the name of the branch you want to analyze.

```bash
preflight review <your-branch-name>
```

The tool will then calculate the diff against the `master` branch, and the AI will begin its analysis.

## Configuration

On its first run, `preflight` will download the required AI model file (this can be several gigabytes) and store it in your home directory at `~/.preflight/models/`.

The model and other parameters can be configured directly within the source code in `src/preflight/ai_reviewer.py`.
